## *Mathematical* Statistics

* 'Founded' by Karl Pearson (1857-1936)

## 'Mathematical Data Science'

* 'Founded' by ? (?-?)

## Background: Big Data

* Data is Pervasive phenomenon that affects all aspects of our activities

* Data diffusiveness is both a challenge and an opportunity

## Effects

* This phenomenon has already revolutionised biology.

* Large scale data acquisition and distribution.

* Transcriptomics, genomics, epigenomics, 'rich phenomics'.


## Societal Effects

* Automated decision making within the computer based only on the data.

* A requirement to better understand our own subjective biases to ensure that the human to computer interface formulates the correct conclusions from the data.



## Societal Effects

* Shift in dynamic from the direct pathway between human and data to indirect pathway between human and data via the computer

* This change of dynamics gives us the modern and emerging domain of data science


## Challenges

1. Paradoxes of the Data Society

2. Quantifying the Value of Data

3. Privacy, loss of control, marginalization


## Breadth vs Depth Paradox

* Able to quantify to a greater and greater degree the actions of individuals

* But less able to characterize society

* As we measure more, we understand less


## What?

* Perhaps  greater preponderance of data is making society itself more complex

* Therefore traditional approaches to measurement are failing

* Curate's egg of a society: it is only 'measured in parts'




## Breadth vs Depth

* Modern Measurement deals with *depth* (many subjects)
    ... or *breadth* lots of detail about subject.
	
* Can deal with large *p* or large *n*
* But what about 
    * *p* roughly equal to *n*?
    * Stratification of populations: batch effects etc.

## Wood or Tree

* Can either see a wood or a tree.

## Examples

* Election polls (UK 2015 elections, EU referendum, US 2016 elections)

* Clinical trial and personalized medicine

* Social media memes

* Filter bubbles and echo chambers


## Solutions

* More classical statistics!
    * Like the 'paperless office'

* A better characterization of human needs and flaws

* Larger studies (100,000 genome)


## Quantifying the Value of Data

There's a sea of data, but most of it is undrinkable

<img src="./diagrams/sea-water-ocean-waves.jpg" width="50%">

We require data-desalination before it can be consumed!


## Value

* How do we measure value in the data economy?
* How do we encourage data workers: curation and management
  * Incentivization
  * Quantifying the value in their contribution

## Credit Allocation

* Direct work on data generates an enormous amount of 'value' in the data economy but this is unaccounted in the economy

* Hard because data is difficult to 'embody'

* Value of shared data: [Wellcome Trust 2010 Joint Statement](https://wellcome.ac.uk/what-we-do/our-work/sharing-research-data-improve-public-health-full-joint-statement-funders-health) (from the "Foggy Bottom" meeting)

## Solutions

* Encourage greater interaction between application domains and data scientists

* Encourage visualization of data

* Adoption of 'data readiness levels'

* Implications for incentivization schemes


## Privacy, Loss of Control and Marginalization

* Society is becoming harder to monitor

* Individual is becoming easier to monitor


## Hate Speech or Political Dissent?

* social media monitoring for 'hate speech' can be easily turned to political dissent monitoring


## Marketing

* can become more sinister when the target of the marketing is well understood and the (digital) environment of the target is also so well controlled


## Free Will

*  What does it mean if a computer can predict our individual behavior better than we ourselves can?


## Discrimination

* Potential for explicit and implicit discrimination on the basis of race, religion, sexuality, health status.

* All prohibited under European law, but can pass unawares, or be implicit.


## Marginalization

* Credit scoring, insurance, medical treatment.
* What if certain sectors of society are under-represented in our analysis?
* What if Silicon Valley develops everything for us?

## Digital Revolution and Inequality?

## Amelioration

* Work to ensure individual retains control of their own data.
* We accept privacy in our real lives, need to accept it in our digital.
* Control of persona and ability to project.


## Awareness

* Need to increase awareness of the pitfalls among researchers
* Need to ensure that technological solutions are being delivered not merely for few (#FirstWorldProblems)
* Address a wider set of challenges that the greater part of the world's population is facing


## Conclusion

* Data science offers a great deal of promise
* There are challenges and pitfalls
* It is incumbent on us to avoid them

**Many solutions rely on education and awareness**
