venue: CSaP Annual Conference
author: Neil D. Lawrence
abstract: >
  In this talk we will firstly set the landscape of machine learning, artificial intelligence and data science by describing what characteristics they share, and how they differ. We'll then shift focus to the promise and challenges associated with both Data Science and Artficial Intelligence, with particular attention paid to the potential for a "data crisis" and challenges in "machine learning systems design".

Here’s what I plan to cover:

*       Clarify relationships between different forms of data use, differentiate between AI, machine learning and data science. 
-          Talk briefly about downstream effects of (1) Data Science. (2) AI on policy. Focus on “The Data Crisis”, the need for more tech expertise and better standards around data, and also challenges of ML Systems.
